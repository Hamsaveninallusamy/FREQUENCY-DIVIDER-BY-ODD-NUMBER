# FREQUENCY-DIVIDER-BY-ODD-NUMBER
The Frequency Divider by Odd Number project is a Verilog HDL implementation designed to divide an input clock signal by any odd integer specified as a parameter. The module uses a counter to generate a clock output with a reduced frequency based on the given division factor. The RTL code is parameterized, allowing users to set the division factor (e.g., DIV_FACTOR = 5) as needed. It includes a synchronous reset signal to initialize the counter and output. A comprehensive testbench is provided to validate the functionality of the frequency divider, including clock signal generation and reset behavior. The testbench simulates the design with an example division factor of 5, demonstrating the generation of a lower-frequency output clock. This project is suitable for applications requiring odd-frequency clock division in digital systems and can be simulated using tools like ModelSim
